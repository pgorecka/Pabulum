# Pabulum

Pabulum is an Android application enabling users to browse recipes from numerous online sources, filtered by diet and meal type. A recipe’s summary displays a clear list of ingredients and additional nutritional information. Recipes can then be saved to a local database for future reference.

Technologies used include:
* Kotlin
* Remote API

Recipes Fragment acts as a landing page. The layout is composed of Card Views stacked vertically one on top of the other. Card Views are part of the Android’s Material Components Library.
